"""Spaced-repetition scheduling.

When an attempt is recorded, we compute when the problem should next resurface.
This is deliberately simple and deterministic — the *selection* of what to
practice is the AI's job (see :mod:`coach.llm`); this module just maintains the
review schedule so due problems exist for the AI to pick from.

The intervals follow a light SM-2-style progression. Everything is stored on the
:class:`~coach.store.ProblemRecord` so it stays inspectable and extensible.
